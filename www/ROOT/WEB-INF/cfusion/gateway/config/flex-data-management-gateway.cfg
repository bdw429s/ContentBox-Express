# send messages to.
# If omitted, a 'destination' key must be in the outgoing struct.
# If specified, any destination in the message is ignored.

# [Optional] The hostname or IP address of the Flex server.
# If omitted, the Flex server is expected to be installed as part

# not installed as part of ColdFusion.

# [Optional] The IP address or addresses of the Flex hosts that
# are allowed to connect and send messages to the Gateway.
# For multiple Flex servers, use a comma separated list: 10.60.1.1,10.60.1.2.
# If not specified, only this host is allowed.

# Control of the ColdFusion to ActionScript conversion of
# property names.  These can also be set in events sent

# if available.

# [Optional] Should we look for "getFoo" or "setFoo" when translating
# an ActionScript object to a CFC? If not found, the value is set in the
# "this" scope.  If your CFCs don't have getters and setters, 
# (they use the this scope) set this to false for better performance.
# Default is true - look for accessor functions.

# [Optional] Should we create CFML Structures instead of CFC value objects

# Default is false (use CFCs)
