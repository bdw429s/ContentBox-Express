<h1>Server Monitor Database</h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Server Monitoring &gt; Server Monitor</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">&#160;</p>
<p>Wherever possible, it's best to allow database servers to handle data 
 manipulation. Adding SQL code to handle this work is much more efficient 
 than doing string manipulations or doing in-memory queries (query of queries). 
 Additionally, stored procedures generally provide a higher level of performance 
 than regular SQL queries. Converting queries in cfquery calls to stored 
 procedures and using the cfstoredproc tag typically improves performance. 
 View database response time information in the Database section of the 
 Server Monitor.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Active Queries page</p>
<p>The Active Queries page lists all currently active queries that take 
 longer to load than the threshold specified on the Slowest Queries page. 
 You can view a list or a detailed view.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Slowest Queries page</p>
<p>The Slowest Queries page provides the Slowest Queries report and the 
 Slowest Queries by Average report. Both reports let you identify queries 
 by template name and line number. The Slowest Queries report shows specific 
 instances of a query that is slow; the detail view includes the SQL. This 
 information lets you determine why an instance of that query was slow. 
 The Slowest Queries by Average report indicates queries that are slow 
 on average. This report does not provide the SQL for the queries because 
 the SQL may vary from one instance of the query to another. Cached queries 
 are not included in either report. To improve performance, tune the queries 
 listed in these reports. If the result of a query is static, you may improve 
 performance by caching the query using ColdFusion’s query cache.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cached Queries page</p>
<p>The Cached Queries page lists the queries that were cached. You can 
 view a list of cached queries or details about an individual query. If 
 the execution time of a query is low, determine if you really need to 
 cache it. If the execution count is high, you should tune the cachedafter 
 and cachedwithin settings of the query.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Query Cache Status page</p>
<p>The Query Cache Status page graphs the number of cached queries, the 
 estimated memory that the query cache consumes, and the query cache hit 
 ratio. The higher the query cache hit ratio, the better the performance. 
 If the cache hit ratio is too low, you may want to increase the size of 
 the query cache. Alternatively, you can analyze how your application uses 
 the query cache by determining whether you can tune the cachedAfter and 
 cachedWithin attributes of the cfquery tag. If the query cache is too 
 large, determine if you can move some queries out of the cache.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Pool Status page</p>
<p>The Pool Status page lists the data sources, whether an application 
 on the ColdFusion server is using the data source, and the number of connections. 
 You can view a list of data sources or details about an individual data 
 source.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Most Frequently Run Queries page</p>
<p>The Most Frequently Run Queries page lists the queries that have been 
 executed the most. Even if individual instances of a query run rapidly, 
 tuning queries with a high frequency can result in improved performance. 
 This report does not provide information about cached queries. You can 
 view a list of queries or details about an individual query.</p>
