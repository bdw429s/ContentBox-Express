<h1>Server Monitor Request Statistics</h1>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">About request handling</p>
<p>The Simultaneous Requests setting on the Settings page of the ColdFusion 
 Administrator has the largest impact on how well an application performs 
 under load. This setting dictates how many threads are used to simultaneously 
 process incoming requests. For most applications, a good starting point 
 for the optimal value for this setting is 3 per processor; you can set 
 a dual processor machine to 6 simultaneous requests. To find the optimal 
 value for this setting, test your application under load with different 
 values until you find the one that provides the best performance under 
 load. While testing your application, you can view the average response 
 time on the Server Monitor Summary page and the reports in the Request 
 Statistics section.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The total number of requests, including queued and running requests 
 reflect the total number of requests actually running or queued in the 
 server. This means that the queue number includes the sum of all queues. 
 The running number does not include those requests that are waiting in 
 a request specific queue.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Request Statistics section contains the following pages:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Active Requests page</p>
<p>The Active Requests page lists all currently active requests that take 
 longer to load than the request interval for reports specified on the 
 Refresh Interval page. Requests include browser requests, CFC HTTP requests, 
 &#160;web services, gateways, and Flash remoting. You can view a list, 
 a detailed view, or a graph of active requests. The detailed view includes 
 the CFML stack trace, which you can use to find where a long running request 
 is blocked and deadlocked requests. To abort a request, click the orange 
 Abort Request button to the left of the request. To see all request graphs 
 in one view, click the Chart button. The report displays graphs that indicate 
 the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span class="rls-1-Bullets"><span style="font-family:'Symbol'">&#183;</span></span><span style='font:6.0pt "Times New Roman"'><font size="1" style="font-size:6pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Average server response time - Data 
 is the average for a minute. A low average response time indicates a server 
 that is operating efficiently.</p>
<p><span class="rls-1-Bullets"><span style="font-family:'Symbol'">&#183;</span></span><span style='font:6.0pt "Times New Roman"'><font size="1" style="font-size:6pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Requests per second - Data is the 
 average for a minute. A high number of request per second indicates a 
 server that is operating efficiently.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 24px; text-indent: -24px;"><span class="rls-1-Bullets"><span style="font-family:'Symbol'">&#183;</span></span><span style='font:6.0pt "Times New Roman"'><font size="1" style="font-size:6pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Running 
 and queued requests (on standalone configurations) - The graph indicates 
 the number of requests currently being processed by the server and the 
 number of requests awaiting allocation of an application server thread 
 to begin execution. If the graph indicates that there is a large number 
 of queued requests, you may want to increase the size of the thread pool. 
 Alternatively, if ColdFusion is deployed in a cluster, you may want to 
 add a server instance for more efficient load balancing</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Note:</b></span> The Server Monitor includes 
 FDS Data Management Assemblers as Flash Remoting requests.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Active ColdFusion Threads</p>
<p>The Active ColdFusion Threads page lists all currently active threads 
 launched by the cfthread tag.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Slowest Requests page</p>
<p>The Slowest Requests page lists the slowest requests. You can specify 
 the threshold that determines whether a request appears on this page. 
 The lower the threshold, the more requests appear on the list. &#160;You 
 can view a list or a detailed view of the slowest requests. The detailed 
 view includes the CFML stack trace.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Slowest ColdFusion Threads page</p>
<p>The Slowest ColdFusion Threads page lists the slowest threads launced 
 by the cfthread tag. You can specify the threshold that determines whether 
 a thread appears on this page. The lower the threshold, the more threads 
 appear on the list. You can view a list or a detailed view of the slowest 
 requests. The detailed view includes the CFML stack trace.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Active Sessions page</p>
<p>The Active Sessions page lists all active sessions. You can view a list, 
 a detailed view, or a graph of active sessions. The graph displays the 
 active sessions and the number of users logged in to the server.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cumulative Server Usage page</p>
<p>The Cumulative Server Usage page lists the requests that have cumulatively 
 used the most CPU time on the server. Even if a request executes rapidly, 
 if it may execute frequently, it can consume a large proportion of CPU 
 time. Tuning requests with high cumulative server time can provide server-wide 
 performance benefits. You can view a list, a detailed view, or a graph 
 of cumulative server usage.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Highest Hit Counts page</p>
<p>The Highest Hit Counts page lists the requests that have the highest 
 hit count. You can view a list or a graph of requests with the highest 
 hit count.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Template_Cache_Status_page" title="Template_Cache_Status_page"></a>Template 
 Cache Status page</p>
<p>The Template Cache status page shows information about the template 
 cache to indicate how well it is performing. The template cache is where 
 ColdFusion stores compiled CFM and CFC templates in memory. When a template 
 is executed for the first time, it is compiled to Java bytecode, and then 
 stored in the template cache. As long as the template is unchanged, ColdFusion 
 uses the compiled form of the template stored in the template cache. The 
 Template Cache status page lets you monitor cache hit ratio, which indicates 
 the number of cache hits in relation to the number of cache misses. Cache 
 hits are the templates retrieved from the cache. Cache misses are the 
 templates that must be compiled before being placed in the cache.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A well performing server should have more cache hits than misses, which 
 is a high cache hit ratio. If the cache hit ratio is too low, you may 
 want to increase the cache size by selecting Server Settings &gt; Caching 
 in the ColdFusion Administrator. The Template Cache page also lets you 
 monitor the number of templates in the cache, and the estimated memory 
 that the cache occupies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b>Note:</b></span> The template cache count 
 includes both the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache and the soft cache. 
 As a result, the count can exceed the number configured in the ColdFusion 
 Administrator.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Request Throttle Data page</p>
<p>The Request Throttle Data page lists all requests that have been throttled 
 by the ColdFusion server. Requests are throttled when ColdFusion queues 
 them because there is not enough total memory available to handle them. 
 Requests smaller than the specified limit are neither queued nor counted 
 as part of the total memory. Requests larger than the specified limit 
 are counted as part of total memory and are queued if the request throttle 
 memory size has been exceeded. The default value is 4 MB. You can change 
 the throttle threshold and memory by selecting Server Settings &gt; Settings 
 in the ColdFusion Administrator.</p>
