WELCOME TO CONTENTBOX EXPRESS EDITION
********************************************************************************
ContentBox is a modular content management engine.  This express edition is NOT
a production ready system but a sample of what ContentBox can do.  There is an
embedded database that is used by our engine with no indexes or performance
tweaks on it.  

The express edition can be used to power a small local site, a local development
environment or for pure demo purposes.

"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;
And patience, experience; and experience, hope:
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the 
Holy Ghost which is given unto us. ." Romans 5:5
